### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Elliott Richard and I'm a Software Engineer 

## Portofolio:


My name is Elliott Richard, a software engineer with a deep passion for developing web applications, finding solutions, developing software, and developing new skills for programming. With my degree on electrical engineering  from ASU and a background in software development taking part in TripleTen's software engineering program, I've honed my skills in many programming languages like Python, JavaScript, Node.js, and CSS as well as interacting with databases like Mongodb. Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to build a software defined radio to create a 3D image of the Hydrogen line, a news app that allows user to search and save articles and a weather app that suggests clothing items to what is appropriate for the weather outside. Whether it's developing efficient algorithms, designing intuitive user interfaces, or optimizing code for performance, I thrive on solving complex problems and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
